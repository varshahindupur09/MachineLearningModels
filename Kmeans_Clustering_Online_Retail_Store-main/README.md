K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.


K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The objective of K-means is simple: group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns.


K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique to classify unlabeled data by grouping them by features, rather than pre-defined categories. The variable K represents the number of groups or categories created.



**K-Means Clustering with Three Cluster Ids.**
Inference drawn by me:

* Customers with Cluster Id 1 have a higher volume of activities than other customers do.
* Cluster Id 1 customers are repeat customers.
* Customers with Cluster Id 2 are less significant from a business perspective because they are not new buyers.
  three cluster labels in a hierarchy of clustering

**Hierarchical Clustering with 3 Cluster Labels**
* Customers who have Cluster_Labels 2 have a higher volume of deals than other customers.
* Customers who purchase from Cluster_Labels 2 frequently do so.
* Customers with Cluster_Labels 0 are not recent buyers and are therefore of the least importance to the company.
