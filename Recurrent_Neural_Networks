## RNNs

### Deep Leaning Architectures:
 * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
 * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
    - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
    - Long short-term memory (LSTM) 
 * Self-Organizing Maps
 * Auto Encoders

* Sequence Prediction:
  Statement: won ____ match
  - She won match
  - He won match
  - They won match

Training process of RNNs through forward propogation and gradient descent

RNN: Forward Propogation
  * Multiple Samples: Each sample is a squence
  * Same model each step
      - Layers, nodes, weights, biases and activation functions
  * Hidden State:
      - Memory from previous layers,
      - Additional input from previous time slice
      - Additional output to next time slice
